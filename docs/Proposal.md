# Metadata Controller

The metadata controller provides capability to add, update, delete and reconcile metadata required for cloud resources.
The scope of the present proposal is to enable continuous management of user-defined tags for cloud resources. The APIs in the 
proposal have been deliberately designed to be modular for extensibility in the early versions. The API will be refined and updated 
based on use-cases towards beta versions.

## Summary

Tagging cloud resources enable users to perform administrative operations like, organize the resources, 
apply security policies, optimize operations, etc. The cloud resources can be tagged using cloud service provider tools, 
kubernetes controllers that create resources via cloud service provider api and other open source tools. A reconciliation 
using a generic metadata controller helps to keep the tags synchronized for cloud resources. 

In the following proposal, the controller supports mainly 
1. Day 2 operations and tag management for cloud resources selected using classifiers.
2. Own the tag list and reconcile to replace any edits performed external to the controller.
3. Opcodes in specification for handling user request as an operation on tag list.
4. Extensible APIs and segregated configuration for controller and cloud provider specific configurations.

## Motivation

Users should be able to maintain lifecycle of tags for cloud resources created during installation or by other day-2 kubernetes
controllers and operators using kubernetes API.

### User stories

As a cluster admin, I want to add tags to the cloud resources created during cluster installation,  which help
for setting security policies.

As a cluster admin, I want tags to be added to the cloud resources created post cluster installation.

As a cluster admin, I want all tags to be added via metadata CR, which helps to reconcile the tag key and values.

As a cluster admin, I want to delete tags, which are not required on the cloud resources.

As a cluster admin, I want to add tags on selected resources, which are identified using specified labels/classifiers.

As a cluster admin, I want to be able to ignore tags on the cloud resource from all operations, which helps to avoid overwriting values 
set by cloud service provider's policies.

As a cluster admin, I want the tag list to be lexicographically sorted, to have a deterministic set of tags applied 
when tag list size exceeds the maximum allowed limit on cloud resource.

As a cluster admin, I want the tag list to be lexicographically sorted, to have a deterministic set of tags appended to 
existing tags for cloud resources when the tag list exceeds the maximum allowed limit on cloud resource.

As a cluster admin, I want to use a CLI, that helps to securely login to cloud service provider and perform management operations for tags.

### Goals

1. Enable continuous management operations (create, append , update and delete) applicable for tagging 
 cloud resources created by kubernetes services.
2. Provide a new custom resource of kubernetes api for specification and status of tags.
3. Enable continuous monitoring of tags applied and reconcile when there are changes made external to 
the controller's API.
4. Provide CLI for operations, cloud service provide authentication and ability to edit custom resource with ease.
5. Provide metrics collection and audit logging features for controller and user operations.

### Non-goals

1. Managing metadata which are not related to cloud resource tagging.
2. Data-related metadata for stored objects and records.
3. Sub-set of input tags to be applied on selected cloud resource.
4. Managing conflict with cloud service provider tagging policies.
5. Preservation of pre-existing tags or tags added using external tools.
6. Regular expression or wildcard characters for classifier tag.
7. Retry mechanism for failed operation during reconciliation.

## Proposal 

A new kubernetes controller to generates actions based on tag specification defined by a custom resource. The controller
reads existing data, applies tags based on opcode and maximum limit policy. The controller would require an initial tag or label, 
that can be used to identify cloud resources to apply and manage tags. Cloud resources can be ignored from being managed 
by the controller by removing the classifier tag on the cloud resource. Controller reconciles the tag list on 
cloud resources periodically at intervals configured by sync period for the controller. 

### Controller configuration

#### Maximum limit policy

Maximum limit policy indicates whether the input tag list can be applied partially when the length of the list exceeds the 
allowed limit on the cloud resource. The result might differ when applied along overwrite policy. Following are the list of valid values.

1. POLICY_APPLY_PARTIAL - Allows input tag list applied to be partial on cloud resource. 
2. POLICY_APPLY_STRICT - Applies input tag list strictly in complete.

### Opcodes

Controller supports different opcodes for actions to add, update and delete tags. Following are the supported opcodes
1. "add" - Controller adds tags to the cloud resources. In case of an existing entry for the tag, the add operation fails with an error.
2. "update" - Controller updates existing tags for the cloud resources. If there is no existing entry, controller tries to 
add the tag to cloud resources based on maximum limit policy.
3. "delete" - Controller removes tags from the cloud resources. In case of specific errors, user intervention may be required to remove tags manually
from the cloud resources.

### Cloud provider authentication

TBD

### High-level workflow

#### Bootstrap
1. User starts the controller with cloud service provider credentials and sync period set.
2. Controller starts to list/watch custom resource.
3. User creates `AWSMetadata` object with tag list details.
4. User creates `CloudMetadata` configuration with controller configuration.
5. Based on the configuration, controller queries and lists all resources based on classifier tag.
6. Creates list of existing tags on cloud resource.
7. Add/update tag workflow is initiated.

#### Add/Update tags

1. User creates `AWSMetadata` object with tag list details.
2. User creates `CloudMetadata` configuration with controller configuration.
3. Controller updates ready condition to false in `MetadataStatus.status`.
4. Controller validates tag entries from `AWSMetadata.spec.resourcetags` and populates a new list of tags to be added to cloud resource.
5. Controller trims the tag list as per maximum limit policy specific to cloud resource.
6. Controller performs lexicographic sorting.
7. Controller replaces the tag list on the cloud resource.
8. Controller updates the tag list to `AWSMetadata.status`.
9. Controller updates ready condition to true in `MetadataStatus.status`.

#### Delete tags

1. User adds tag key list (optionally, value, for validation) to custom resource specification.
2. User specifies operation to be performed on the tag list by specific opcode.
3. Controller updates ready condition to false in `MetadataStatus.status`.
4. Controller gets the active tag list, removes requested tags from the list and populates a new list of tags.
5. Controller replaces the tag list on the cloud resource.
6. Controller updates the tag list to `AWSMetadata.status`.
7. Controller updates ready condition to true in `MetadataStatus.status`.

#### Handling of pre-existing tags or tags added using other tools

In case of add operation, controller appends tags to existing tag list. If there is any tag pre-existing with same key name, 
there will be an error reported for the operation. While, in case of update operation, the pre-existing tag is updated. There is 
no distinction made between pre-existing tags and tags in `AWSMetadataSpec` for reconciliation. The active tag list is listed in the status.

#### Classifier tag behaviour

Classifier tags are used to enable controller to get applicable cloud resources to manage tags. Classifier tags are mandatory and should
be added to cloud resource. Controller does not support any wildcard characters in classifier strings. 
When multiple classifiers are used, a logical OR condition is applied for the classifiers.

#### Reconciliation

Reconciliation of tags is ignored when ready condition is set to false at `MetadataStatus.status`. Reconciliation of tags is based on active tag list in `AWSMetadata.status.resourcetags`. On deletion of AWSMetadataRef 
or invalid reference, controller does not perform any reconciliation. Ready condition is set to false at `MetadataStatus.status`.

#### No cloud provider configured

When there is no cloud provider object configured, there will be no operation by default.

### STS/Non-STS support

TBD

### Drawbacks

1. User intervention maybe required in some cases for failure resolution of opcode driven operations.
2. Any user with permission to edit custom resource can influence tags on cloud resources with wide-scoped classifiers.
3. HA is not supported for the controller.
4. Override of global configurations specific to cloud provider are not supported.
